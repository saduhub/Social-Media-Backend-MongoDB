## Description

This project serves as the backend infrastructure for a social media platform. The motivation behind building this project was to demonstrate proficiency in working with MongoDB, Mongo Atlas, Mongoose, Insomnia, and Express technologies. By creating this backend, I aimed to showcase my skills in designing and implementing a backend that supports various social media functionalities. This code provides solutions for essential social networking features like post and comment management as well as friend requests.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:

- **MongoDB and NoSQL Databases**: I deepened my understanding of MongoDB's document-oriented database model and learned how to design effective schemas.

- **Mongoose ORM**: I honed my skills in using Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, to define models, establish relationships, and perform CRUD operations.

- **Express.js**: I strengthened my knowledge of building RESTful APIs using Express.js, including handling routes, middleware, and request/response management.

- **Database Deployment**: I learned how to deploy and manage a MongoDB database using Mongo Atlas, ensuring data reliability and availability.
